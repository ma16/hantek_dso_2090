Installation Notes:

The project provides only the source code and needs to be compiled to create an executable tool. 

The source is written in C99. There is one exception: Access to time-related function is based on POSIX.1-2001 (see systime.c). So this project should hopefully compile and run at least on all Posix compliant platforms.

Contributions:

The Hantek DSO is accessed by USB. This project makes use of libusb (libusb.info), a great library that provides a userland API for the USB protocol. Thus, in order to compile this project, this library needs to be installed beforehand (whether build or installed as package).

Installation Example:

The build system is an i3-2120 on (a fresh) Ubuntu-16.04.1 Desktop Amd64 (2017-01-11) which is using gcc version 5.4.0.

$ sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
$ wget https://github.com/ma16/hantek_dso_2090/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master
$ cd hantek_dso_2090-master/src
$ make
$ ./dso2090 

The last command should give you a diagnostic message of the tool.

This was also tested with an ARMv7 (BCM2836 aka Raspberry Pi-2) on (a fresh) Raspbian Jessie (2016-09-23) which is using gcc version 4.9.2.

Notes:

On Linux you may want to place an udev-rules-file into /lib/udev/rules.d/ (or wherever your distro recognizes them) to enable non-root permissions for USB devices. I.e.

ATTRS{idVendor}=="04b4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2090", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="04b5", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2090", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"
