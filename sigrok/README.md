The sigrok project (http://sigrok.org) supports besides others, also the Hantek DSO-2090.

It seems however, that the implementation holds some bugs. There are issues with the configuration, the trigger and the sampling rate. Here's the related source code with a few comments (marked as [ma16]).

Unfortunately I couldn't discuss these issues with the sigrok people. The registration for the bug tracking system wasn't working. I sent an eMail to the guy to contact if something went wrong but got no response. I joined also the #sigrok channel and talked to one of engineers and got never a feedback. So this is this.

Maybe someone stumbles at one time about the comments and may find them helpful.
